# GnomeFetch
is a neofetch like tool, but for GNOME!

## How to install
Only way rn is too build yourself, but I'll setup flatpak builds after I free some space, the sdk is too big for my computer's disk to handle, if someone wants to do for me I would appreciate it!

## How to build
I personally use fleet.rs for builds, since its fast, but its not required

### With fleet
```bash
fleet build # for build
fleet run # for running
```

### With regular old cargo
```bash
cargo build # for build
cargo run # for running
```
